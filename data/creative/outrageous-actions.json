      "title": "Bizarre Disguises & Masquerades",
      "content": "Create an outrageous disguise—think a mismatched costume, an absurd wig, or even a magical mask—that lets you infiltrate an enemy lair or a guarded gala unnoticed.

      "id": "double-dare",
      "title": "Double-Dare Decisions",
